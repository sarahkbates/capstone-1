<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I need to make an app that has a product page, a shopping cart page, and has a search bar
* I know how to make a gallery in vanilla HTML, but not in react
* People say that it's easier if you use Bootstrap, but I don't know how to use bootstrap
* I do not know how to make a search bar
* My product details have to go into a json file, and then I need to be able to change the data using .map, but I'm not very 
comfortable using .map
* My ultimate goal is to have a hover feature over my products so that you see the item, and then hover over and can see
my dog wearing the item. I saw people do it with their HTML websites, but I don't know how to do it.
* I'm not sure which piece to start with...do I make the json file with my products first, or do I start with the page layout
* 
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Google how to refactor vanilla HTML to react
    -compare the todo list app I made in react with a todo list app made in vanilla html
* Learn about bootstrap
* Design what my page should look like (I'm going to do this on a piece of paper, because that makes the most sense to me)
* Start with products in the json file
* Then move to the page layout, with a header and a footer
* Add in a nav bar
* Make pages for the nav bar
